    <h2>･:+:8/11/2023 Lazy day･:+.</h2>
    <p>Hey there! To be honest, I'm not doing so hot these days.
      But it's rainy outside which makes for a very cozy day.
      I don't have the energy to put in much effort, so let's be lazy today!

      <h2>･:+:19/10/2023 Weedburger･:+.</h2>
    <p>Pretty nice and sunny day. It's October but it's still warm as hell which sucks :(
      On the bright side, a friend came to visit me for lunch! Instead of going out 
      to a restaurant, we decided to hit up our local Albert Hijn and buy supplies to
      cook up our own little meal.
