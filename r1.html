      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <P>For these delicous burgers we used white buns, tomatoes, pickles and vegan mayo</P>

     <P>We just got these patties from the store so we didn't wait long before chucking them into the pan.</P>
     <p>As always, I don't have exact temperatures or times for you (Worlds best cooking blog right here)</p>
     <img src="./Images/R1_cook1.jpg">
     <P>While the patties were a sizilin', we cut up the tomatoes and toasted the buns in the airfryer</P>

     <P>After seeing the burgers looked crispy, I decided to cut one open with the spatula to check if the inside looked cooked</P>
     <img src="./Images/R1_cook2.jpg">
     <P>And before we knew it, we had to lovely looking burgers ready for human consumption</P>

     <h2 class="titlecase">Thoughts</h2>
     <p>all in all, I didn't think they were that good. The texture was intersesting,
        but there just wasn't any taste there to back it up. Maybe the pickles were too overpowering?

     <p> A real ghost burger, just in time for Halloween!</p>
