      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>Hi there! Alot's been going on and even more's been on my mind lately.
        so apologies if this is a bit more low-effort than was expected
      </p>
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <P>I picked up these Beyond Smash patties on my way home, let's see how they do</P>

     <P>I took them out of the packaging and smooshed them down with my cheese slicer </p>

     <img src="./Images/R3_prep2.jpg">
     <P>Unfortunately, I smooshed them too wide, so I had to put them one by one in the airfryer. I set it up to 180 degrees for 15min,make sure to check on them and flip them every so often</P>

     <P>Watching some Drawfee while we wait</P>

     <P>It's nice and cozy out</P>

     <P>I used what I had laying around for these burgers, so some buns and some goat cheese (naturally lactose free, fun fact)</P>
     <img src="./Images/R2_final.jpg">
     <p>And there we have it, a lazy meal for a cozy day</p>
     <h2>Thoughts</h2>
     <p>The patties were really nice and crispy from being in the airfryer,
        the cheese melted nicely.
        Great meal for a not-so-great day
     </p>
